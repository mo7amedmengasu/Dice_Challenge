# 🎲 Dice Game

## 📌 Overview
This is a simple web-based dice game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The main purpose of this project is to practice and improve skills in:
- **DOM Manipulation**
- **CSS Styling**
- **HTML Structure**

Every time the page is refreshed, two virtual dice roll, and the result determines the winner between **Player 1** and **Player 2**, or if it’s a draw.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout of the page.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for generating random dice rolls and updating the DOM accordingly.

## 📂 Project Structure
📁 Dice Game │── 📄 index.html # Main HTML file │── 📄 styles.css # CSS file for styling │── 📄 index.js # JavaScript file for game logic │── 📁 images # Contains dice images (dice1.png, dice2.png, etc.)

## 🎯 How It Works
1. The game loads with both dice showing an initial face.
2. On **page refresh**, the JavaScript code:
   - Generates two random numbers (1-6).
   - Updates the dice images according to the numbers rolled.
   - Displays the winner based on the higher number or declares a draw.
